# VIT-MARKET-BILLING-APP
A polished and friendly command-line billing system where customers can add products, enter prices, and get a professional-style receipt. The app includes tax calculation, input validation, and a realistic “printing receipt” animation to enhance the shopping experience.
VIT Market Checkout System 🛒
📋 Project Description
The VIT Market Checkout System acts as a digital Point of Sale (POS) terminal. It allows a cashier to enter products and prices dynamically, handles errors (like invalid prices), and generates a professional, tax-inclusive receipt at the end of the transaction.

Key Features
Dynamic Interaction: The system greets the user and assigns a random cashier (Himanshu, Aryan, Priyanshu, or Jainam) for a personalized touch.
Robust Input Validation:
Prevents empty product names.
Ensures prices are numbers.
Rejects negative pricing logic.
Professional Receipt Generation: Uses Python's f-string formatting to align text and currency perfectly.
Automated Calculations: Automatically calculates subtotal, applies an 8% tax rate, and computes the final total.
Simulated Realism: Includes a "printing" delay effect using the time module.

Technologies Used
Language: Python 3.x
Modules:
random: For random cashier selection.
time: To simulate printer delay. 

How to Run
Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Save the file: Save your Python code as main.py (or any name you prefer).
Run the script: Open your terminal or command prompt and type:
<!-- end list -->

Future Improvements
Inventory System: Connect to a dictionary of pre-set items so prices look up automatically.
Save to File: Export the receipt to a .txt file instead of just printing to the console.
Discount Logic: Add functionality for coupon codes or student discounts.
